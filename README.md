# Isabelle/HOL solutions to math contest problems

This repository contains my solutions to various interesting problems from math olympiads
and other similar contests. These are formal proofs in [Isabelle/HOL].

TODO: render the theories to PDF or HTML to allow viewing them online - the `\<symbols>` can be quite hard to read.
